style.css (Various Versions)
These CSS files provide the visual styling for the 2D HTML elements (like game-over or victory screens) overlaid on the A-Frame scenes.

They set basic styles for the #app container, ensuring it fills the browser window.
They define styles for #game-over, #game-win, or #game-victory elements.
These UI elements are typically positioned in the center of the screen.
They are hidden by default (display: none).
Some versions apply semi-transparent backgrounds.
One version adds a blinking animation (blinker) to the victory screen.
collider-check.js
This component is a simple debugging tool.

It requires the raycaster component to be present on the same entity.
It adds an event listener for raycaster-intersection.
When an intersection occurs, it logs the intersected elements to the console.
log-gltf-animations.js
This component helps inspect animations within loaded GLTF models.

It listens for the model-loaded event.
When a model loads, it accesses its animations.
It logs the names of all found animation clips to the console.
obstacle.js
This component defines an object that can potentially be destroyed or interacted with.

It has a strength property, defaulting to 100.
It tracks damage and a hasBeenDestroyed flag.
It listens for a collide-with-character event, increasing damage upon firing.
If damage exceeds strength, it removes the entity from the scene.
In the "Mining" and "Shooting Gallery" scenes, these entities are used as targets or blocks rather than being destroyed by collision.
Scene 1: Mining/Resource Gathering
This scene focuses on a player using tools to break down "trees" (represented by boxes).

main.js (Mining Version)
Imports: Loads A-Frame, extras, physics, and custom components including character (player), obstacle, collider-check, and log-gltf-animations.
Assets: Preloads 3D models for an axe and a pickaxe, and a grass texture.
Environment: Sets up a sky, a green ground box, and a blue "water" box.
Trees: Creates several "trees" using pairs of a-box entities (one for the trunk, one for leaves). These boxes have the obstacle component and are static-body.
Player: An a-entity with camera and the player component. It has look-controls disabled. It includes an entity holding the tool model (#axe initially). A raycaster is attached, set to detect obstacle entities up to 3 meters away.
character.js (Mining player Version)
State: Manages player moveSpeed, tiltSpeed, key presses (w, a, s, d, space, m), a set of hitTargets, a flag isBreaking, the current breakingBlock, the number of blocksMined, and the currentTool.
Input: Listens for key presses to control movement, start breaking blocks (Space), and switch tools ('m').
Tool Switching: The switchTool function allows changing between the axe and pickaxe (if 5 blocks have been mined) by changing the gltf-model attribute.
Block Breaking: startBreaking uses the raycaster to find an obstacle. If a valid block is found, it starts a tool animation, waits 2 seconds, removes the block, updates blocksMined, makes blocks above fall down, stops the animation, and checks for victory.
Movement: The tick function updates the player's position based on 'w'/'s' keys and rotation based on 'a'/'d' keys.
Scene 2: Dog Collection
This scene involves a character exploring and collecting dogs from houses.

main.js (Dog Collection Version)
Imports: Loads A-Frame, extras, physics, its CSS, and components character, obstacle, collider-check, and house.
Assets: Loads models for a tree, character, house, and three different dogs, plus a grass texture.
Environment: Includes a sky and a grass-textured ground.
Houses: Creates three house entities, each with the house component configured for a specific dog model.
Character: An a-entity with the character component, physics body, character model, and a raycaster.
Camera: A separate camera entity is positioned to view the scene.
character.js (Dog Collection Version)
Movement: Uses CANNON.Vec3 for physics-based movement, controlled by arrow/WASD keys, and updates character animations.
Dog Collection: In its tick function, it checks for nearby house entities. If close, it calls pickupDog on the house. It tracks collected dogs and shows a victory screen when all are collected.
Dog Following: Collected dogs are positioned around the player and follow their movements.
(Note: house.js was provided in previous interactions but not in the final set. It defines the house component used here.)

Scene 3: Shooting Gallery
This scene is a target shooting game.

main.js (Shooting Gallery Version)
Imports: Loads A-Frame, extras, physics, its CSS, and components character (player), obstacle, collider-check, and log-gltf-animations.
Assets: Loads a pistol model and grass texture.
Environment: Includes a sky and a ground plane.
Targets: Creates three targets using cylinders and spheres; the spheres have the obstacle component.
Player: An a-entity with camera, player component, look-controls (disabled), the pistol model, and a raycaster set to hit obstacle entities.
character.js (Shooting Gallery player Version)
State: Tracks keys and a Set of hitTargets.
Input: Listens for W, A, S, D, and Space.
Aiming: W/S keys control pitch (X-rotation), and A/D keys control yaw (Y-rotation).
Shooting: 'Space' triggers shoot, which uses the raycaster. If an obstacle is hit and hasn't been hit before, it adds it to the set and triggers fall/move animations on the target.
Win Condition: Checks if all targets have been hit and displays the game-win screen.
Scene 4: Teleportation Puzzle
This scene involves using raycasting to interact with boxes and teleport.

main.js (Teleportation Version)
Imports: Loads A-Frame, extras, physics, its CSS, and components character, obstacle, and raycaster_detecion.
Assets: Loads three planet textures.
Environment: Includes a dark sky and lights.
Boxes: Creates many a-box entities with planet textures. They have the raycast-blab component and are classified as fake, real, or final.
Player: An a-entity myCamera with camera, character, look-controls, wasd-controls, and a raycaster set to interact with raycast-blab objects. (Note the typo odbjects instead of objects).
(Note: raycaster_detecion.js and its corresponding character.js were provided in previous interactions but not in the final set. They define the raycast-blab and simple character components used here.)
